# MovieVerse ðŸŽ¬

A React Native app that uses the TMDB API to help users discover and browse movies. This is my submission for the Buy Me a Coffee hiring challenge, built as a proof of concept to demonstrate React Native development practices.

> âš  Note: The TMDB API might be blocked in India. If you don't see any movies loading, you'll need to use a VPN.

## Design Choices

### List Screen
The main screen uses a responsive card layout that adapts to different device sizes. On phones, it shows a single column with detailed movie information, while tablets display a grid to utilize the larger screen space.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbd3e662-8a09-44db-8892-8e62be8f5dc9">
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daca672f-46fc-4218-be62-83f931797fdd">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="">
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
Each movie card contains:
- Title and release year
- Rating displayed as a 5-star system (converted from TMDB's 10-point scale)
- Genre tags
- Popularity indicator using a simple progress bar

### Details Screen
A straightforward two-section layout that responds to device orientation:
- Portrait: Stacked layout with poster image on top and details below
- Landscape: Split view with poster on left and details on right
This simple approach works well across different screen sizes without overcomplicating the UI.

### Technical Decisions
- Used React Context instead of Redux for state management, keeping the app simple
- Implemented infinite scroll for better performance with large datasets
- Added local caching using AsyncStorage to improve app responsiveness
- Built with TypeScript for better code reliability
- Used Expo for faster development and easier testing

## Implementation

### Core Requirements
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS & Android)
- Movie browsing with infinite scroll
- Search functionality
- Responsive layouts
- Dark/Light theme support
- Offline data caching

### Additional Features
- Real-time search with debounced API calls
- Multiple movie list filters (Upcoming, Now Playing, Top Rated)
- Favorite movies system
- Orientation-aware layouts
- Loading state indicators

## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
1. Node.js & npm
2. Expo CLI
   bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   
3. Android Studio (for Android development)
4. Xcode (for iOS development, macOS only)

### Installation Steps

1. *Get the code and install dependencies*
   bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd movieverse
   npm install
   

2. *Configure environment*
   Create a .env file in the project root:
   env
   EXPO_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://api.themoviedb.org/3
   EXPO_PUBLIC_AUTH_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
   

3. *Start the app*
   bash
   npx expo start
   
   Use a for Android, i for iOS, or scan the QR code with Expo Go.
